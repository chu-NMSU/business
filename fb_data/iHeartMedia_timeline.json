Susan Shacka talks about her disease.\nRelated Links\n\u2022\tSusan Shacka's Facebook page Ataxians Helping Other ataxians\nSIOUX CITY |  For years Susan Shacka worked as a secretary in Orange County, Calif. Now, the 56-year-old types with one finger.\nHer speech is slow and choppy. Her gait is staggering as she moves about her quaint northside apartment, steadying herself on the back of a chair.\nEveryday tasks like putting the cap back on a tube of toothpaste and cooking a meal are a struggle for Shacka.\nThe Council Bluffs, Iowa, native, who moved to Sioux City in 2012 to be closer to family when her tremors worsened, suffers from a rare form of ataxia -- a degenerative disease of the nervous system that affects her movement and balance.\n\"I had tremors. My handwriting was getting worse. I was dropping cell phones. I knew I had a problem,\" Shacka said in slow choppy speech as she sat at her computer.\nSince the closest support group for people suffering from ataxia is over three hours away in Des Moines, Shacka turned to the Internet to gain support and spread awareness. She formed the community page: \"Ataxians Helping Other Ataxians\" on Facebook to communicate with others around the world who share her condition.\n\"My mission is to get the word out. This could happen to them,\" she said.\nAccording to the National Ataxia Foundation, an estimated 150,000 Americans are affected by some form of ataxia, which is most often caused by a loss of function in the cerebellum.\nAtaxia, which can be hereditary or sporadic, often begins in an individual's 20s and 30s, but a person may not show symptoms until their 60s. Children also suffer from ataxia.\nElizabeth Hartman, Shacka's neurologist at CNOS is Dakota Dunes, said genetic disorders, stroke and diseases such as multiple sclerosis can cause ataxia. Shacka, she believes, has an autoimmune form of ataxia.\nShacka lost 80 pounds in 2009 after lap-band surgery, then her health rapidly declined. She developed Guillain Barre Syndrome, an autoimmune disorder where the body's immune system attacks part of the peripheral nervous system which connects the central nervous system to the limbs and organs. Shacka spent eight months in a skilled nursing facility learning how to stand and walk again.\nToward the end of 2011, Shacka noticed her hands had begun to shake. Trouble swallowing and slurred speech followed. After nearly eight months of appointments and testing, she was diagnosed with ataxia at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. Shacka, who receives physical, occupational and speech therapy, said her condition hasn't worsened or improved.\nAccording to Hartman, current ataxia research is focusing on deep brain stimulation. Results, she said, have been mixed so far.\nPhysical therapy, she said, is a \"mainstay\" of treatment because it can improve muscle strength and decrease the risk of falls in patients who struggle with walking and balance.\n\"Some of our patients need to have an assist device like a walker or even a cane that can help them walk as well,\" she said.\nShacka, who uses a walker outside of her apartment, longs for a cure and to return to the life she lived before ataxia.\n\"I want to write and I want to type. I want a job. I don't want to be on disability the rest of my life,\" she said.\n\nSusan Shacka  *  712-560-1518  *  Iowasue57@yahoo.com", "id": "10152270043277914_10152271806767914", "user_likes": false}, {"from": {"id": "536921089757794", "name": "Stephen Richards"}, "like_count": 0, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2014-07-17T22:01:03+0000", "message": "According to a Kings Island representative, in 1981, Taft Broadcasting owned Kings Island in Mason, Ohio.

Really?? Is that what we need??\n\nThis past week here in San Antonio Clear Channel Radio debuted a new Rhythmic \"Hip Hop and Throwback oldies\" station on 104.5FM, which replaces a long time Rocker KZEP, which has been relegated to a lesser 93.3FM repeater frequency. Come on Clear Channel is that the best you can do? Really???\n\nThey really dropped the ball with a Hip Hop format!!\n\nNews Flash Clear Channel: The majority of people over 35 years old are not into Hip Hop!! Isn't one Hip Hop station here (98.5 the Beat www.thebeatsa.com) enough? Who are your consultants making these kind of stupid decisions? Did anyone ask the listeners of this region what they need in the FM market here? I talk to people in San Antonio everyday about what this radio market needs, and an over whelming majority agree that R&B and Smooth Jazz stations in particular are missing from this airwaves in this market.\n\nIt's been over five years now since Clear Channel made the decision to take away KSJL, which was the only R&B station left in the region. Somehow they felt that they could not sell \"R&B\" radio in this market, so after this long hiatus I suppose the powers that be seem to be awakening to the fact that it really doesn't make good business sense to continue to simply ignore over 300,000 Black, Hispanic and White households in the greater San Antonio area that used to listen to R&B music. Yes, as quiet as it me be kept, some Mexican and White households also listen to R&B music. While taking away the city's only R&B station was not a good idea, it really isn't the smartest move to now bring a second Hip Hop station into the market without have anything for adult R&B listeners to listen to.\n\nNow just over a year ago in Austin Entercom started a R&B for adults (www.963rnb.com) which currently now has a listenership of over a 50% share of the urban market in that city. What's wrong with San Antonio? Wake up and understand that only kids are into Hip Hop and they have a station, what about the grown folks with disposable income that continue to be ignored on the FM airwaves here? Oh, well, I guess it will take them another 5-10 years to learn what this market really needs.\n\nThe music on the airwaves in the San Antonio region is awful when compared to other cities of a similar size. So many people listen to out of town Satellite/XM radio, Pandora, and other internet radio stations. Some even listen to Cable TV music because the music here is so bad!! For far too long there has be a very strong monopoly of the radio market here primarily by two big corporations, Clear Channel and Cox radio. They don't want any outside competition, and they won't change their ways, even when the public has been on their case about it for years. As long as they can make the lions share of the radio profits in San Antonio they seem to say, if it ain't broke, why try to fix it. Unfortunately, that's not reality, and I think they are slowly realizing this.\n\nI started and internet radio station, www.1067thebridge.com in 2010 to help balance out this lopsided radio market here in San Antonio and beyond where there aren't R&B stations. We also play Smooth Jazz and Gospel music on the weekend. This is because no station is playing this kind of music exclusively among the FM stations here in San Antonio. I have wanted to take my format to the FM radio here, but no one in the large corporations would even listen to me to let me pitch them the format for their consideration. Dan Lawrie, the head of Cox Radio in San Antonio, hung up on me when I tried to ask him for a meeting to talk about radio in San Antonio.\n\nHe said he didn't even what to listen to anything that I had to say, despite the fact that I've worked on the air in several radio markets (Washington, DC, Cleveland, Columbus, VA Beach and San Antonio) and my 30 years in the business didn't even merit me a courtesy meeting about it with Cox Radio here in San Antonio. I haven't got the money to buy my own station here, so I'm doing the next best thing, which is broadcasting on the internet. It's a great new medium, and it allows people from all over the world to listen in. In time, internet radio may eventually eclipse terrestrial (AM/FM) radio.\n\nIt seems that my work will and must continue. In the meantime, we here at the Bridge will continue to bridge the musical gaps here and beyond with my online radio station, www.1067thebridge.com, that continues to play R&B music for adults who don't want to hear a bunch of profanity and \"stupid\" music, which is what most of today's Hip Hop music brings to our community. Sorry, but I just had to go there!! I strive to bring music and information that is uplifting and positive for everyone in general and the Black Community in particular. I think \"Classy\" radio is solely missing from the airwaves today because most big corporations have simply sold the concept of responsible broadcasting out for the money that people with no moral values will throw at them. Do our young women need to be schooled on the latest \"twerking\" dance? Really? is that that best we can do for our young people?\n\nI say we as broadcasters can do better, we can elevate what radio delivers to its audience and we can help the community to improve, not just stay stuck on stupid!! I for one will not play exploitation music that sells our people out!! I also know that if you listen to more positive radio formats, then you will love it and get some enlightenment along the way.\n\nPlease drop by the Bridge anytime and check out for yourself what I'm talking about!! Just click on this link: www.1067thebridge.com. I hope you'll support our efforts and help us stay in a place to offer an alternative to the status quo of crappy radio that dominates San Antonio's radio airwaves these days!! I hope to eventually raise enough money to buy an FM station to fight for a real R&B radio station in San Antonio, however, since that's a tall order, in the meantime I'll keep doing what we do here on the internet.

He has no more credibility in this town. He is an angry guy. How about making his wife Holly the new trouble shooter!! Everyone is rooting for her because Tom is such a jerk lately. She knows trouble shooting better than anyone, next to tom. And Kayla, who has been on the show, and answering phones, get her on as a co-host like Mike was for Tom before he left. If Holly Martino doesn't want the job, give it to the Kayla girl. She is good and caring and is great with people. Something Tom is so over. It's really no fun to listen to his ti-raids.

Evolution 101.7 was diffrent because of the fact compared to normal radio stations around the Boston area, It gave us a reason to turn on our radios and listen to the radio.

Movement to the city of Boston. \n\nGetting rid of Evolution 101.7, Boston's Home Of All Things Dance, Is not fair to the loyal listeners of the station and the people of the greater boston area, And in the people an insult to the EDM Evolution and the EVOLUTION as a whole. So we are asking for Clear Channel Communications to put Evolution 101.7 Back on the airwaves and to give the people of Boston back the station which many of us have grown to love and become common listeners to.\n\nIf you still are not sure why you should support this petition and why the listens of this station are upset, Lets look at the reasons why.\nGetting rid of Evolution 101.7 Is Like Getting Rid Of A Entire Genre as a whole, It will remove the amount of varity that we the people of the radio will have.\nThe listeners of the station and greater boston community WE WERE NOT EVEN INFORMED OF THIS CHANGE, NO NOTICE, NO WARNING, NO ANYTHING.\nReplacing Boston's ONLY E.D.M. Station is a shame to begin with, But replacing it with ANOTHER Country Station, is just simply a waste of a Radio Station.\nBoston was one of the first cities in the NATION to have thier own E.D.M.

All of us are in some measure slaves of the federal government. Through their oppressive tactics of telling the ranchers how many cows they can have on their land, and making that number too low to support a ranch, the BLM has driven every rancher in Clark County off the land, except me. The IRS keeps the people of America in fear, and makes us all work about a third or a half of the year before we have earned enough to pay their taxes. This is nothing but slavery from January through May. The NSA spies on us and collects our private phone calls and emails. And the government dole which many people in America are on, and have been for much of their lives, is dehumanizing and degrading. It takes away incentive to work and self respect. Eventually a person on the dole becomes a ward of the government, because his only source of income is a dole from the government. Once the government has you in that position, you are its slave.\nI am trying to keep Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream alive. He was praying for the day when he and his people would be free, and he could say I\u2019m free, free at last, thank God I\u2019m free at last! But all of us here America, no matter our race, are having our freedom eroded and destroyed by the federal government because of its heavy handed tactics. The BLM, the IRS, the NSA--all of the federal agencies are destroying our freedom. I am standing up against their bad and unconstitutional laws, just like Rosa Parks did when she refused to sit in the back of the bus. She started a revolution in America, the civil rights movement, which freed the black people from much of the oppression they were suffering. I'm saying Martin Luther King's dream was not that Rosa could take her rightful seat in the front of the bus, but his dream was that she could take any seat on the bus and I would be honored to sit beside her. I am doing the same thing Rosa Parks did--I am standing up against bad laws which dehumanize us and destroy our freedom. Just like the Minutemen at Lexington and Concord, we are saying no to an oppressive government which considers us to be slaves rather than free men.\nI invite all people in America to join in our peaceful revolution to regain our freedom. That is how America was started, and we need to keep that tradition alive.\nCliven D.

The music went from telling kids to have fun in the park or engage in activism, to telling them to use drugs all day and blow each other\u2019s brains out. Most psychologists and marketing scholars know that this kind of influence on young people breeds a desensitization to violence and deviant behavior.\n\nA group of parents, consisting of Lauren Horst and other concerned citizens of Chicago, have had enough.  The group is asking Clear Channel to show more responsibility in the kinds of music it selects to be played on both WGCI and the Big Jam Concert that is coming up this year.  The group also says that it is no coincidence that most of the violent lyrics speak of black-on-black violence, but the stations would likely not allow lyrics that promote black-on-white violence or black-on-gay attacks.\n\nHere is the letter below.  You can join the conversation on their Facebook page: \n\nOpen Letter to Clear Channel concerning the content of the music played on WGCI and the upcoming Big Jam Concert!!\n\nConcerned Citizens Against Violence, Clear The Airwaves Project and Substance Over Nonsense along with other community groups are asking Clear Channel to PLEASE discontinue broadcasting music that is disrespectful to your listeners. The mere fact is that there is rash of violence, broken families, drug used and s****l exploitation going in the society. While Black People are disproportionately affected, they are not the only group that is been affected by these dysfunction symptoms. There are other races that are listening to this music that are trying to cope with the negative behaviors often imitated from the music. In just about every song in the urban/hiphop market that Clear Channel owns and operates the topics are either about violence, s*x drugs or disrespecting women. The violence is about Black on Black violence I never hear lyrics about someone committed a violent act on a white person it is almost always N***er(a) nor is White on White violence a theme on your stations. It will not be tolerated, because it is disrespectful. It does not matter what race is the focus on the lyrics, it is still disrespectful and unnacceptable. Why are positive artist, such as Lupe Fiasco not getting airplay on your urban stations? We only hear the negative artist. Because these negative groups are the vast majority of the artist played on your stations our youth are don\u2019t have much of a choice but to listen to 2chainz, Meek Millz and etc. ", "id": "10151878165787914_29500974", "user_likes": false}, {"from": {"id": "10203083745074423", "name": "Lisa Steller"}, "like_count": 0, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2014-03-28T14:11:51+0000", "message": "really? who gives a %&^@$ ! bring back tommy lee", "id": "10151878165787914_29948244", "user_likes": false}]}, "actions": [{"link": "https://www.facebook.com/280975072913/posts/10151878165787914", "name": "Comment"}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/280975072913/posts/10151878165787914", "name": "Like"}], "updated_time": "2014-04-07T00:36:46+0000", "caption": "www.billboard.com", "link": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/5847578/how-beyonce-shocked-radio-too-an-exclusive-qa-with-clear", "likes": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTAxNTI1NDc1OTU5MTM1NDY=", "before": "ODA2MDQ5MTk2MDg0MjA1"}}, "data": [{"id": "806049196084205", "name": "Saranace Saran"}, {"id": "10152346261396067", "name": "Mary Jane Collins"}, {"id": "10152480966309873", "name": "Sandi Waite"}, {"id": "743747415713338", "name": "Arryon DiFebo"}, {"id": "767484249951662", "name": "Maury Howell"}, {"id": "765119056872688", "name": "SkGz NeYa"}, {"id": "1427641280824299", "name": "Loriann Gutierrez"}, {"id": "625785704192170", "name": "Nath\u00e1lia De Fran\u00e7a"}, {"id": "10152050666626618", "name": "Agnes Nishka"}, {"id": "1474975389386718", "name": "Vicky Rivera"}, {"id": "243197019173853", "name": "The Underbelly of a Mega Church"}, {"id": "622336391169343", "name": "Luiz Arduini"}, {"id": "10201847438924005", "name": "Mitchell Feinberg"}, {"id": "258559864316367", "name": "Westley Branton"}, {"id": "10203564902550209", "name": "Rose Schwarz"}, {"id": "827583523950002", "name": "John Mandes"}, {"id": "10152768811228664", "name": "Silvia Quir\u00f3s"}, {"id": "10152791680758082", "name": "Dana Holtzman Greenberg"}, {"id": "10202004559099284", "name": "Dianne Fabrocini"}, {"id": "10203177803860763", "name": "Lauren Hight"}, {"id": "102705306437", "name": "TequilaMe"}, {"id": "10152547595913546", "name": "Joe Carlson"}]}, "created_time": "2013-12-20T16:28:48+0000", "message": "What did you think of Beyonce's album release?

Most psychologists and marketing scholars know that this kind of influence on young people breeds a desensitization to violence and deviant behavior.\n\nA group of parents, consisting of Lauren Horst and other concerned citizens of Chicago, have had enough.  The group is asking Clear Channel to show more responsibility in the kinds of music it selects to be played on both WGCI and the Big Jam Concert that is coming up this year.  The group also says that it is no coincidence that most of the violent lyrics speak of black-on-black violence, but the stations would likely not allow lyrics that promote black-on-white violence or black-on-gay attacks.\n\nHere is the letter below.  You can join the conversation on their Facebook page: \n\nOpen Letter to Clear Channel concerning the content of the music played on WGCI and the upcoming Big Jam Concert!!\n\nConcerned Citizens Against Violence, Clear The Airwaves Project and Substance Over Nonsense along with other community groups are asking Clear Channel to PLEASE discontinue broadcasting music that is disrespectful to your listeners. The mere fact is that there is rash of violence, broken families, drug used and s****l exploitation going in the society. While Black People are disproportionately affected, they are not the only group that is been affected by these dysfunction symptoms. There are other races that are listening to this music that are trying to cope with the negative behaviors often imitated from the music. In just about every song in the urban/hiphop market that Clear Channel owns and operates the topics are either about violence, s*x drugs or disrespecting women. The violence is about Black on Black violence I never hear lyrics about someone committed a violent act on a white person it is almost always N***er(a) nor is White on White violence a theme on your stations. It will not be tolerated, because it is disrespectful. It does not matter what race is the focus on the lyrics, it is still disrespectful and unnacceptable. Why are positive artist, such as Lupe Fiasco not getting airplay on your urban stations? We only hear the negative artist. Because these negative groups are the vast majority of the artist played on your stations our youth are don\u2019t have much of a choice but to listen to 2chainz, Meek Millz and etc. ", "id": "10151506303827914_29500992", "user_likes": false}]}, "actions": [{"link": "https://www.facebook.com/280975072913/posts/10151506303827914", "name": "Comment"}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/280975072913/posts/10151506303827914", "name": "Like"}], "updated_time": "2014-02-17T08:24:34+0000", "caption": "clearchannel.com", "link": "http://clearchannel.com/Pages/Berlin-School-and-Clear-Channel-Launch-Competition-for-Leadership-in-Audio-Innovation---Winner-Receives-Full-Tuition-Schola.aspx", "likes": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTAxNTI3NjM2MTA0NDI1NDI=", "before": "NzQ0NTcwNTg4OTA4ODY3"}}, "data": [{"id": "744570588908867", "name": "Derrick Oldham"}, {"id": "10152379882349357", "name": "Tina Follico Newman"}, {"id": "10152329254366201", "name": "Je Morales"}, {"id": "770489379648459", "name": "M.a.

The music went from telling kids to have fun in the park or engage in activism, to telling them to use drugs all day and blow each other\u2019s brains out. Most psychologists and marketing scholars know that this kind of influence on young people breeds a desensitization to violence and deviant behavior.\n\nA group of parents, consisting of Lauren Horst and other concerned citizens of Chicago, have had enough.  The group is asking Clear Channel to show more responsibility in the kinds of music it selects to be played on both WGCI and the Big Jam Concert that is coming up this year.  The group also says that it is no coincidence that most of the violent lyrics speak of black-on-black violence, but the stations would likely not allow lyrics that promote black-on-white violence or black-on-gay attacks.\n\nHere is the letter below.  You can join the conversation on their Facebook page: \n\nOpen Letter to Clear Channel concerning the content of the music played on WGCI and the upcoming Big Jam Concert!!\n\nConcerned Citizens Against Violence, Clear The Airwaves Project and Substance Over Nonsense along with other community groups are asking Clear Channel to PLEASE discontinue broadcasting music that is disrespectful to your listeners. The mere fact is that there is rash of violence, broken families, drug used and s****l exploitation going in the society. While Black People are disproportionately affected, they are not the only group that is been affected by these dysfunction symptoms. There are other races that are listening to this music that are trying to cope with the negative behaviors often imitated from the music. In just about every song in the urban/hiphop market that Clear Channel owns and operates the topics are either about violence, s*x drugs or disrespecting women. The violence is about Black on Black violence I never hear lyrics about someone committed a violent act on a white person it is almost always N***er(a) nor is White on White violence a theme on your stations. It will not be tolerated, because it is disrespectful. It does not matter what race is the focus on the lyrics, it is still disrespectful and unnacceptable. Why are positive artist, such as Lupe Fiasco not getting airplay on your urban stations? We only hear the negative artist. Because these negative groups are the vast majority of the artist played on your stations our youth are don\u2019t have much of a choice but to listen to 2chainz, Meek Millz and etc. ", "id": "10151461884442914_29500984", "user_likes": false}]}, "actions": [{"link": "https://www.facebook.com/280975072913/posts/10151461884442914", "name": "Comment"}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/280975072913/posts/10151461884442914", "name": "Like"}], "updated_time": "2014-02-17T08:23:28+0000", "caption": "www.bloomberg.com", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-14/clear-channel-billboard-creates-water-from-peru-humidity.html", "shares": {"count": 1}, "created_time": "2013-05-16T15:03:36+0000", "message": "Learn about a Clear Channel Outdoor billboard that provides clean water to its community.", "icon": "https://fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net/rsrc.php/v2/y5/r/sXJx2UP7quc.png", "type": "link", "id": "280975072913_10151461884442914", "status_type": "shared_story", "description": "A billboard is extracting enough drinking water out of humid air to help supply a Peruvian village near Lima with about 96 liters (25 gallons) a day, Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings Inc. said."}, {"picture": "https://fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net/safe_image.php?d=AQA7zmJCUrvQeyCC&w=158&h=158&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.billboard.com%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2Fpromo_310%2Fpublic%2Fmedia%2Fclear_channel_640.jpg", "from": {"category": "Media/news/publishing", "name": "iHeartMedia Inc.", "category_list": [{"id": "2233", "name": "Media/News/Publishing"}], "id": "280975072913"}, "name": "Clear Channel Study Says Terrestrial Radio Still Draws Huge Numbers", "privacy": {"value": ""}, "comments": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZFhKemIzSTZNVEF4TlRJd05UZ3pNVGM0TkRJNU1UUTZNams1TkRrd056TTZMVEU9", "before": "WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZFhKemIzSTZNVEF4TlRFME5UYzRNRGMyTXpjNU1UUTZNall5TURRME1EazZMVEU9"}}, "data": [{"from": {"id": "831876586846885", "name": "Gary Evans"}, "like_count": 0, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2013-05-13T18:55:05+0000", "message": "KRENN!!!!!!", "id": "10151457784032914_26204409", "user_likes": false}, {"from": {"id": "872566229422350", "name": "Diane Creamer"}, "like_count": 0, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2013-05-15T18:58:12+0000", "message": "Want to know how to pack your bar, club, lounge, restaurant, with \"FUN\" and \"WOW\" and \"FAB\" using Clear Channel Radio, go to promotingnightclubs.com", "id": "10151457784032914_26231745", "user_likes": false}, {"from": {"id": "10202265819886127", "name": "Tom Roelke"}, "like_count": 0, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2013-05-16T13:30:56+0000", "message": "So every now and then I turn of the MP3 player and actually listen to the radio.

It deals with the absolute disgust I felt this afternoon as I listened to your program at approximately 4:00(pm) and the nausea it continues to produce as I think of it at this moment. I am somewhat familiar with your personalities but am uncertain if the person on air was Bill Carroll, Bill Handle or John or Ken but there was a female co-host who made equally disturbing comments and I wanted let all of you know how pitifully unprofessional you sounded.\n\n\tLet me preference this further by stating with absolute certainty that were I involved in the decision making process at KFI, everyone involved in today\u2019s production would be out of a job. Unfortunately, I am not but may I suggest that each of you formally apologize to your listening audience for your crude, insensitive and crass comments. Apologize to the citizens of this country for the degrading manner used as you totally disrespected the United States Constitution, minimized the principles that govern this nation and spoke in a treasonous form that should have had you brought up on charges. There is no excuse for you behavior.\n\nNow, the topic that were so offensive, dealt with the homeless and I need to say; up front that each of you have a right to state your opinion on whatever subject you choose but you had damn well understand that you are in a position to be heard where most are not and you need to remember those facts. The fact that many people are too foolish to understand that you are not reporting the news but are simply commenting on it is irrelevant. The fact that you are supposed to be very high paid professionals with concern for fellow human beings and who love their country, is a relevant fact and you failed on all parts this afternoon and I intend on pointing this out in detail.\n\nMy recall of the comments may not be verbatim and I was only able to stomach the program for 20 minutes but the persons involved will remember and will recall every syllable and my hope is that great suffering comes as a result of my words. To the on air personalities, I say, \u201cPay attention \u2026 you pathetic excuse for a civilized human being\u201d. To the station manager, I offer this advice, Do your job and hold the people under you accountable for their actions. To those individuals in the corporate tier, I ask \u2026\u201dIs it your policy to have anti-American people who have no feelings for anyone other than themselves as they bring shame and embarrassment to your company, also an important factor to your stock holders\u201d. I seriously doubt this is a possibility.\n\nThis afternoon and in heavy traffic, as I listened to KFI, I became so enraged that I had to pull from the road to compose myself. I was beside myself as I listened to a gentleman, on air say,:\u201dHomeless people are a menace and should be ignored\u201d, or something to that effect. He went on to suggest that the homeless coalition was a criminal enterprise whose only goal was to spread propaganda. He suggested that it was perfectly fine to have to police remove a homeless person from an area for nothing more than begging for something to eat.\n\ncontinued ...", "id": "10151457784032914_26763645", "user_likes": false}, {"from": {"id": "10201890306934344", "name": "Ken Pressley"}, "like_count": 0, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2013-06-28T09:46:29+0000", "message": "His unbelievable assertion that most homeless people suffer from a mental condition and should therefore be shunned by everyone; telling a caller to avoid speaking to any homeless person, caused me to yell aloud, \u201cWhat !\u201d Believing I had heard the worst was a foolish assumption on my part because it got more horrific as long as this idiot spoke. I had no choice other that to pull into a parking lot and shut my radio off when I heard him say the most outlandish thing I have ever (in 53 years), heard anyone say, especially on the radio.\n\n\u201cHomeless people deserve no help and it is a good thing when the police take them away \u2026 they should all be arrested because \u2026 what is the guy gonna do? Claim his rights were violated?  Homeless people have no rights and who cares about violating their rights, they are an annoyance\u201d. Just prior to my turning the radio off, a female announced had the presence to chime in with a jovial comment about witnessing a police or sheriffs officer harassing a homeless person and they all treated the topic like it was a freak show at a carnival and that the Constitution and Bill of Rights was something they had read from the back of their ticket stub.\n\nHow dare you people disrespect my country!?  Who the hell gives you the right to decide which people deserve kindness and charity? Have you always been a pompously arrogant asshole that has convinced him \u2026 or her-self that your farts are different from everyone else because they do not stink? I have news for you both because they do stink just like everyone\u2019s but you are different as you contend. Unique, actually because you have actually reached a place that classifies you as the only two people on this planet that I would loathe any time in your presence.\n\nThat is correct, the most despicable people on the planet, worse than George W. Bush or Barack Obama. No, I do not have a political affiliation that I blindly follow and I call it as it is observed. A thief is a thief, a liar is a liar and pathetic individuals are scum and that is where you are identified. No, I am not finished yet, you need to hear a rebuttal to your stupidity and understand that being a moron is no excuse and become fully aware that you are actually nothing more that the \u2018no-bodies\u2019 you denigrate with your filthy words.\n\nAllow me to point out a few things that you have obviously overlooked so \u2026 wake up and pay attention, this is important. Your insane belief that people really want to be homeless if they are homeless proves the level of stupidity and I speak from experience. Being homeless is not as glamorous as you might think and in fact, it is as pathetic an existence as you could possibly imagine in your worst nightmare. Yes, I lived as a homeless person for ten very long months. Did I need help?

Now, before you begin to blame that sort of an attack on another homeless person, think again because 99% of the time, it will be from a normal person. Someone half drunk or just kids wanting to be mischievous but either way, who cares, they will get away with it because, \u2018Who Ya\u2019 Gonna turn to for help, the Police? And also by this time, all those specific items you chose to save from extinction at the beginning of the ordeal have been long gone for some time.\n\nMore than likely, stolen from you when you had your back turned or even out right robbed; strong armed style and that meant you had to start all over. That probably explains to pitiful way you are dressed but you might feel good about the amount of weight you have lost since thus began and so you start to calculate the exact amount you have lost and realize that you have lived on the streets for nearly a half a year and the only possible thing you could accomplish is to simply survive from day to day. You\u2019ve come to understand that no business will hire you because they couldn\u2019t.\n\nYou look at yourself and wonder what would the people who worked there, think if you showed up everyday for work, pushing a shopping cart that you had to bring inside to keep from having it stolen and wearing the same clothes every single day \u2026 plus, that smell? You might start to question your use of time and wonder why nothing had gotten any better. That may be the point that you realize that had you not collected recyclables and traveled to great distance to sell them and traveled the great distance for a free meal that you would probably have starved to death and then \u2026 and only then, will you realize how badly you had acted towards people in need.\n\nAs for that bonehead notion of who has rights and who cares if some are violated and what is a homeless person to do if his rights are violated, I will answer this question and you had better pay attention. You sonofabitch, You are supposed to care, You are supposed to stand for your brother when you see this happen. You are to be the one he comes to for help and You should cherish the opportunity to help in any way you can and without limitations because you may one day find yourself in his shoes you sonofabitch!\n\nTrust me, I know you all think the same way and that includes that idiot Bill Handle because if he were any sort of a decent Lawyer, he\u2019d know that it is illegal to violate a persons rights. It is also illegal to suggest or coerce others to violate the rights of ANYONE and you did just that, so do you turn yourself in or make it right? I doubt any of you have the guts to turn yourselves in for breaking the law but you may be able to muster the courage to apologize and start doing the right things in life. God, I hope so because I am sick up to my eyeballs with the propaganda this radio spews out all day long, it\u2019s sickening.\n\nWhy don\u2019t you do what is right for this country like demanding criminal Politicians be removed from office and that any, past or present violators be prosecuted in the same way they would gladly prosecute you or I without a thought.

Credible research has been completed on the content of music that you allow to air on our radio stations (please click on link below to read Appeal Letter and statistics) and I am outraged at the results.  This content promotes violence, drug and alcohol abuse, hypersexuality and misogyny, and criminal activity.  \n\nAlthough your initial response might be, \u201cWell, it\u2019s all about free speech and not censoring art\u2026\u201d, this is not the initial response of the hundreds of parents in Jacksonville who have lost their children to senseless violence.  Can you honestly look these parents in their faces and tell them that their precious children died because of free speech?  Have you ever talked to a mother who lost her son because someone blew his brains out for \u201csnitching\u201d to the police?  Have you ever talked to a father who\u2019s daughter was viciously raped by five men because they felt entitled to her body because she\u2019s \u201cjust another b*$#@!\u201d?   \n\nI\u2019m bringing this to your attention because I\u2019m choosing to believe that perhaps you are not aware of what is broadcasted here in Jacksonville.

Clear Channel fired Denver's most beloved radio personality, Uncle Nasty.  Uncle Nasty has always been a huge supporter of the local music scene and .  Clear Channel doesn't give a damn about local talent.  In Denver we're all about local everything, from shopping at mom and pop stores to local bands!  Firing Uncle Nasty was a bad move on the part of Clear Channel.  Uncle Nasty has been on Denver's airwaves for decades amassing a huge following.  KBPI ruined their own station pushing that iHeartRadio app.  Why should Denver have to suffer because Clear Channel can't do their job?

I purchase a 2011 Chevy Suburban that comes with a SiriusXM 6 month trial.  The one channel that made it worth it to me to pay for the subscription is taken away & replaced with a regular old FM station that plays almost the exact same format as The Highway. Not to mention a station that people in the Nashville area get for free! Now, you want to tell me that to continue to hear the station that I paid for, I need to either purchase a newer phone & pay for a data package (for the IHEARTRADIO app), a laptop (for IHEARTRADIO online) or an audio adapter?? I happen to have a home computer that handles my computer needs.  We are a family of 7 with one working adult. We pay for a SiriusXM subscription for one car. In times like these it isn't in our budget to buy new gadgets & increase our phone package to accomodate data use. Why should it cost the hard working, paying subscribers any more money than it already does to hear the music we want to hear?  We have called & emailed & get the same canned responses over & over! We once lived in a time where the customers mattered. Your decision to replace NASHVILLE 57 with a free FM station makes it clear that you do not value the opinions of the customers.
